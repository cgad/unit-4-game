# Crystals Collector Game

## OBJECTIVE

The objective of this game is to match your score with the target score exactly. You win when you've matched the two scores. You lose when your score exceeds the target score.

## INSTRUCTIONS

At the start of the game, each of the four crystals on the screen is randomly assigned a numerical value, and the target score is randomly generated. Your score starts at 0. Increase your score by clicking on a crystal with your mouse. Your score is updated with each crystal click. You can determine the value of each crystal by noting how much your score increases upon each click. Try to match your score to the target score by clicking a combination of the crystals. When you match the scores, your "wins" count increases by one, and the game restarts. When you overshoot the score, your "losses" count increases by one, and the game restarts. Both the crystals and target score will have new values.
